# Overview

I have been wanting to learn more about unity. I also wanted to do a Boids simulation. I didn't add anything new but followed along trying to understand the code and how it works. I started by trying to use DOTS but to my understanding unity is no longer supporting it. I might go back and try to impliment this but that is in the future.

Boids follow 3 principles

-  separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
-  alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
-  cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

Using these priciples and some colision detection these item look like flocking birds or schools of fish.

# Future Work

-  Impliment DOTS.
-  Make my own models.
-  Learn more about the math behind the collision detection.
